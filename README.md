# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
A large portion of employees at PH are expected to retire soon. This project analyzes various data sets to determine potential employees who may retire. We also propose a mentorship program to elevate the impact of retirees. There are multiple data sets in SQL that will be used for this project.

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze multiple employee data sets for PH regarding retirees. 

## Analysis
PH appears to be a great place to work based on two factors. First, many employees have spent their entire careers at PH. This is very rare in todayâ€™s workplace environment of job-hopping indicating PH treats their employees well. Second, many employees have held numerous roles. This shows the potential for one to grow their career. Two titles make up 2/3 of retirees, senior engineer and senior staff. This will help focus PH efforts to replace these departments. 

## Results
There are 72,458 potential retiring employees across 7 departments.
